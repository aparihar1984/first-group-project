Project 1 Interactive Front-End Application!

Creating an application that solves a real-world problem while working with a team of developers.

## Introduction

For this project, our team created an application that allows users to learn about a comic character of their choice, as well as that character’s (or any other comic character’s) past production history by entering any comic character into an input box which will then send a server-side API request for a set of data specific to that comic character.

Our application features HTML and CSS pages powered by JavaScript.

## Criteria

To meet the Accepted Criteria of this project, we created an application that features the following:

When the application is opened, an Introductory Page displaying links to the various pages as well as an explanation of the purpose of the website appears.

When the Character Search link is clicked, the user is taken to a character search page where they can enter an input (comic character) of their choice to discover more details about that character.

When the Productions Search link is clicked, the user is taken to a production search page where they can enter an input (comic character) of their choice to discover if any productions (movies or television shows) have ever been made about that character.

Once a comic character (input) has been entered into the input box in both the Character Search and Production Search pages, an API request is made to our server-side APIs (rapidapi.com and omdbapi.com respectively) for the data.

If any data exists for the user input (comic character), a display card will appear with the data.

When the Meet the Team link is clicked on the “Introductory Page”, the user is taken to a page that provides a brief introduction to our application development team.

## References

To complete this project, our web developer team studied the following class activities as references:

Module 2-Advanced CSS:

“01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen”

Module 4-Web-APIs:

"07-Ins_Create-Append"

"08-Stu_Create-Append"

Module 5-Third Party-APIs:

“13-Ins_Bootstrap-Layout”

Module 6-Server-Side-APIs:

"03-Ins_Demo-Fetch" 

"17-Ins_Fetch_Options"

“18-Stu__Fetch_Options”

"23-Ins_Review-Part-Two"

Our team also searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites for references (note that our two Server-Side APIs are included):

"https://rapidapi.com/yasindusamarasinghe10/api/superhero-api/"

“https://www.omdbapi.com/”

"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"

"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp"

"https://releases.jquery.com/"

"https://getbootstrap.com/"

"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/css"

"https://chat.openai.com/"

"https://copilot.microsoft.com/"

The process of coding for us involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and then commenting out every section of code in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.

This led to a lot of experimentation to see what we felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as we could in the given time frame.

The experimentation was necessary because while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code alone DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria.

It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code specifically does will lead to more complications instead of a working application.
